## 🎯 Lab Overview

This lab introduces the foundational concepts of **Bash shell scripting** in Linux.  
The objective was to build structured, executable automation scripts that demonstrate variables, conditions, loops, file handling, reporting, and backup automation.

All exercises were performed on a cloud-based Ubuntu Linux environment.

## 🎯 Objectives

By completing this lab, I achieved the following:

- Understood the structure of Bash shell scripts
- Implemented shebang notation and execution permissions
- Used variables and environment variables
- Captured user input dynamically
- Applied conditional logic (if/elif/else)
- Performed numeric comparisons and validation
- Built for loops and while loops
- Developed nested loop logic
- Automated system information collection
- Created file management automation
- Built a complete backup automation system with:
  - Logging
  - Verification
  - Rotation policy
  - Reporting
